## MyRezzi
MyRezzi is a web application that is used to create beautiful resumes that are hosted as a site as well as downloadable as a PDF. We believe that not everyone should be a photoshop expert in order to create a eleqant resume to stand out to an employeer.

## Built on Laravel
MyRezzi is built on the Laravel5 framework. I'm a PHP newbie so if anyone has any suggestions, please make a pull request and leave clear comments. If you are downloading this to install make sure of a couple things..

1)install composer on your machine
2)configure you .env file
3)setup your config/database.php file
4)create database in MySQL accordingly
5)run 'php artisan migrate' to create databases

**NOTE** I am using MAMP and you'll notice in the config/database.php. Please adjust accordingly
